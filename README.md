# FactoryHub - TCF

**FactoryHub - TCF** is a web-based front-end portal built as a third-party application for the open-source ERP ecosystem. The application serves as an operational front end for business users, while the main transactional backbone remains **iDempiere v12**.

In this architecture, FactoryHub - TCF provides a more focused user experience for day-to-day operations, approvals, reporting, and document handling, while iDempiere acts as the core ERP back end responsible for master data, accounting logic, document lifecycle, and enterprise transaction processing.

## Project Overview

This project is being prepared for implementation at **PT Tri Centrum Fortuna (TCF)** in **2026**. The current scope covers a growing set of operational modules that support procurement, warehouse, sales, finance, approvals, and reporting workflows. The application is intended to continue evolving after the initial rollout, with additional modules and refinements planned as business requirements mature.

## What Is iDempiere?

**iDempiere** is an open-source ERP and CRM platform designed for integrated enterprise operations. It provides the core business engine for areas such as procurement, sales, inventory, accounting, workflow, and document processing. In this project, **iDempiere v12** functions as the system of record and transactional back end, while FactoryHub - TCF delivers a tailored web interface aligned with the operational needs of the implementation.

## Current Functional Scope

Based on the menu structure and active application routes in this repository, the implemented modules currently include:

* **Dashboards** for procurement, petty cash, sales, delivery, and warehouse monitoring
* **Procurement workflows** including Purchase Requisition, Purchase Order, Material Receipt, Approval PR, and Approval PO
* **Sales and distribution workflows** including Sales Order, Delivery Schedule, Customer Shipment, and related document processing
* **Finance workflows** including AP Invoice, AP Payment, AR Invoice, AR Receipt, Petty Cash Request, and Petty Cash Closing
* **Reporting features** including Procurement Report, Purchase Order Report, Aging AP Invoice Report, and Aging AR Invoice Report
* **Supporting capabilities** such as authentication, role-based access flow, document printing, attachment handling, journal export, and selected repost processes

## Technology Stack

FactoryHub - TCF is currently built on:

* **Laravel 12** for the application framework and backend orchestration
* **Tailwind CSS v4** for the user interface layer
* **Alpine.js** for lightweight client-side interactivity
* **Vite** for frontend asset bundling and development workflow

## 📋 Requirements
To set up FactoryHub - TCF, make sure your environment includes:

* **PHP 8.2+**
* **Composer** (PHP dependency manager)
* **Node.js 18+** and **npm** (for compiling frontend assets)
* **Database** - Works with SQLite (default), MySQL, or PostgreSQL

### Check Your Environment

Verify your installations:

```bash
php -v
composer -V
node -v
npm -v
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aji-sanjaya/FactoryHub-TCF.git
cd FactoryHub-TCF
```

### Step 2: Install PHP Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

This command will install all Laravel dependencies defined in `composer.json`.

### Step 3: Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you prefer yarn or pnpm:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Step 4: Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**For Windows users:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Or create it programmatically:**

```bash
php -r "file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');"
```

### Step 5: Generate Application Key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

This creates a unique encryption key for your application.

### Step 6: Configure Database

#### Option A: Using MySQL/PostgreSQL

Update your `.env` file with your database credentials:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=factoryhub_api
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Create the database:

```bash
# MySQL
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE factoryhub_api;"

# PostgreSQL
createdb factoryhub_api
```

Run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 7: (Optional) Seed the Database

If you want application menu and supporting seed data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Step 8: Storage Link

Create a symbolic link for file storage:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

## 🏃 Running the Application

### Development Mode (Recommended)

The easiest way to start development is using the built-in script:

```bash
composer run dev
```

This single command starts:
- ✅ Laravel development server (http://localhost:8000)
- ✅ Vite dev server for hot module reloading
- ✅ Queue worker for background jobs
- ✅ Log monitoring

**Access your application at:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Manual Development Setup

If you prefer to run services individually in separate terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Laravel Server:**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Assets:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

#### Build Frontend Assets

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Optimize Laravel

```bash
# Clear and cache configuration
php artisan config:cache

# Cache routes
php artisan route:cache

# Cache views
php artisan view:cache

# Optimize autoloader
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

#### Production Environment

Update your `.env` for production:

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```


## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite using Pest:

```bash
composer run test
```

Or manually:

```bash
php artisan test
```

Run with coverage:

```bash
php artisan test --coverage
```

Run specific tests:

```bash
php artisan test --filter=ExampleTest
```
